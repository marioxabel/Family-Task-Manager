# TasKid
Being a parent isn't easy, especially when managing chores for multiple children! This app helps assign household chores and self-care tasks—like washing dishes, taking showers, and completing homework—while rewarding kids with points for completing these tasks. The best part? They’ll be excited to do them to earn fun rewards like ice cream, trips to the park, or even a big prize like a trip to Disneyland!
